I am a software engineer, musician, and husband. I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2017
with a Bachelor of Software Engineering.

I make [Hacklily](https://hacklily.org), a web-based sheet music editor and publishing tool. It survived
the front page of Hacker News and uses Rust, Docker, React, and TypeScript. If you are a
musician and/or developer, you should [check it out](https://www.hacklily.org).

Before that, I made the most purchased podcasting app for BlackBerry 10. I also made a Khan Academy client
for BlackBerry 10 during a hackathon that saw a lot of use.

I am an avid learner, builder, and explorer. I thrive in projects where the right architecture isn't
obvious and where experience across the entire stack is important.
