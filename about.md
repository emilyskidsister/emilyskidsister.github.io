![Profile of Jocelyn Stericker](/JocelynStericker.jpg)

I am a software engineer, musician, and cyclist. I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2017
with a Bachelor of Software Engineering.

I make [Hacklily](https://hacklily.org), a web-based sheet music editor. It
survived the front page of Hacker News and uses Rust, Docker, React, and
TypeScript. If you are a musician and/or developer, you should [check it
out](https://www.hacklily.org).

I am an avid builder and explorer. I thrive in teams where I can be both a
learner and a teacher. I seek projects where the right architecture isnâ€™t
obvious and where experience across the entire stack is important.

If you are still reading, you might be interested in my slightly out of date
[resume](/JocelynStericker.pdf).
