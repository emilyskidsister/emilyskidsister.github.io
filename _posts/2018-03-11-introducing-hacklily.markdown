I've been working on an online LilyPond editor in my spare time, and
would appreciate your feedback. You can use it as a scratchpad, or sign
in with a GitHub account to save sheet music directly there.

Try it at [hacklily.org](https://www.hacklily.org)!

It's inspired by great projects like LilyBin and Overleaf.

You can give me feedback by replying to me, or on [GitHub](https://github.com/hacklily/hacklily).

I hope you find it useful and am looking forward to your feedback.
