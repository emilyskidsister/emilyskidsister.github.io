In this series, I'm going to build Oxygen, a voice journal and audio analysis toolkit for people who want to change the way their voice comes across. In the first episode, we're making a CLI clone of the "Voice Memos" app on Apple platforms â€” it lets you record and play back audio clips. In the next few videos, I'll talk about audio compression/encoding/decoding and make our CLI app a little more fully featured. Later on, I will also be building a UI and diving into audio processing and analysis.
