My
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/coach/class/__demo__/program/BrainTraining2018" target="_blank">most recent project</a> (sign-in required) at
Khan Academy was a fun program for teachers
designed to motivate and engage their students. It takes advantage of
peer pressure &mdash; the more assignments a class completes, the more progress
they'll have to celebrate on the Brain Training progress tracker.
The design was by <a href="http://jacobgreif.com" target="_blank">Jacob
Greif</a> and I coded it.

During this project, I had a chance to use Apollo GraphQL for the first time
and am a fan. The project is designed to be reskinable and customizable so that
we can launch other similar programs around the year, and customize them for
different countries and locales.

It's nice to work on a project that gets this kind of reaction (make sure to
turn sound on!):

And this is why I love my job.
